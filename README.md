# YinYang: A MERN-Stack E-commerce Application

Welcome to Fusion Electronics, a MERN-Stack E-commerce Application! This project is a a full-stack web application that was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It aims to provide a comprehensive example of building a modern e-commerce platform, covering frontend user interface, backend server logic, database management, and integration with third-party libraries.

## Introduction

his project is a demonstration of building an e-commerce application using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB (database), Express.js (server), React.js (frontend), and Node.js (runtime environment). The application allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and simulate the order processing. It includes basic validations for user inputs and simulates the checkout process on the backend.

## Features

- Product Management:

  - View a list of products.

  - Simulate the order creation process on the backend.
  - Receive confirmation of order success.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React.js
  - tailwind for styling
  - Axios for API requests
  - Redux for store manangement
- Backend: - Node.js - Express.js - MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM) - Axios for external API requests - Swagger for API documentation - AWS S3 for file, image upload and store
  -Development Tools: - VisualStudio (IDE) - Git (version control) - npm (package management)
